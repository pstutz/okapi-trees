/**
  * This is the basic tree node class. Usually it makes more sense to use `AbstractTreeNode`, which uses reflection
  * to generate the `children` and `withNewChildren` field/method. Our benchmarks show that manually implementing
  * them can result in a speedup of a factor of ~3 for tree rewrites, so in performance critical places it might
  * make sense to extend `TreeNode` instead.
  *
  * This class uses array operations instead of Scala collections, both for improved performance as well as to save
  * stack frames during recursion, which allows it to operate on trees that are several thousand nodes high.
